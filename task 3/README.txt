Hotel Reservation System 🏨
A functional and beginner-friendly Hotel Reservation System built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project was developed as part of Task No. 2 during my internship at Smart Trainers.

📌 Project Overview
The system is designed to help hotels manage their daily operations efficiently. It allows the management to register guests, track room availability, handle bookings, and automate the billing process.

✨ Key Features

Room Management: Add new rooms with specific room numbers and prices.


Real-time Availability: View a list of rooms that are currently free for booking.


Guest Registration: Store guest details, including name and contact information, upon booking.


Automated Billing: Calculate the total stay cost based on room price and number of nights.


Check-Out System: Clear guest data and mark the room as "Available" once the guest leaves.

🛠️ System Architecture (OOP)
The project is structured into three primary classes to demonstrate clean code and logic building:


Room Class: Stores the room number, price, and occupancy status.


Guest Class: Holds the personal details of the individual staying in the hotel.


Hotel Class: Serves as the main controller to manage rooms, bookings, and check-outs.
